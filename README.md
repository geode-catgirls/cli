# Geode Command Line
Command-line utilities for working with [Geode SDK](https://geode-sdk.org).

For more information see its [page on the docs](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/getting-started/geode-cli).

## Usage
The CLI is typically invoked for you by Geode's build system, but it does have some standalone features:

``` bash
# Walks you through creating a Geode mod via a template
geode new

# Runs Geometry Dash from the default profile
geode run

# Installs the sdk. For more info see the docs
geode sdk install

# Uploads a mod to the index. For more info see the docs
geode index mods create
```
